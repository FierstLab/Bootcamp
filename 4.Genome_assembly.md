## What is assembly? A quick review

There are two types of assembly, reference based (generally more referred to as alignment), and de novo, meaning "from the beginning." When choosing between the two, it is essential to keep in mind the purpose of your experiment as well as data available. Alignment is used when there is a reference genome available and your goal is more to understand variation in populations. Alignment has less strigent requirements, being possible with 20-30x depth of coverage and shorter reads. De novo assembly is used when a species has never been sequenced before. For de novo assembly it is generally recommended to have 60x depth of coverage and some type of long read sequencing. De novo assembly is what we will focus on today and it will simply be called assembly from here on.

Genome assembly is like a puzzel. The ideal assembly is exactly the number of chromosomes a species has. For _caenorhabditis_ nematodes, their genome contains 6 chromosomes, 5 autosomes and an X (they have an XX/XO sex determination system, instead of XX/XY like humans). Thus, the ideal assembly for these nematodes would be 6 pieces. But puzzels can be tricky sometimes, like if the pieces are very small (short read sequencing), if pieces are missing (lack of coverage), or if pieces are identical (repeat regions). You will see in this tutorial that genome assembly varies wildly with the amount of data used and your choice of assembly software.

## Obtain the data

Although each of you have your own data, we will use some test data for this assembly exercise so we are all on the same page. Some of these programs can also take up to a day to run depending on the amount of data you have. On the other hand, following this tutorial with the test data should only take an hour or two depending on your pace.

    cp /home/data/jfierst/JU4121/cat_fastq_pass_JU4121_noClassData/JU4121_classPractice_ont.fastq ~/.

Check file size to see how much data you have. Type:

    ls -lath JU4121_classPractice_ont.fastq

Look at the file. Type:

    head JU4121_classPractice_ont.fastq

Remember the format of a fastq? A fastq has 4 lines. The first begins with an @ sign. This is the sequence identifier line. In our data this line also contains useful information about the nanopore run, such as sample_id (except ours is blank because we did not give it a sample id), the date and time of the experiment, and the basecalling model used. The second line is the sequence itself (ATCG). The third is usually just a + sign, but sometimes repeats the identifier line. Finally, the fourth is quality information and should look like random symbols ("#$$''+''&$&'). For example, a $ sign is a Q score of 3, meaning that there is only a 50% chance that that base was called correctly. 

## Quality Check the Reads

There are several ways to look at the raw data. We will look at coverage and quality.

<details>
<summary><b>Depth of Coverage</b></summary>

We are going to use the awk language to process our fastq file and give us the total amount of base pairs in the fastq file.

    awk '{if(NR%4==2) total+=length($0)} END {print total}' JU4121_classPractice_ont.fastq > total_amount_of_base_pairs.txt

Once you see the prompt ($) then your command finished. 

This command is saying that if the current line number equals the second of every group of four lines, then count the characters and add the count to total. At the END, print the total and store it in total_amount_of_base_pairs.txt 

Make sure total_amount_of_base_pairs.txt was created and is in the current directory by typing:
    
    ls
    
Now view the contents in the total_amount_of_base_pairs.txt, type:

    head total_amount_of_base_pairs.txt
 
It's time to calculate the sequencing depth. The equation is: Sequencing depth of coverage formula= 
Total base pairs sequenced / Genome size​	( In our case the genome size will be 100,000,000 == 100Mega base pairs)

You may use a calculator. Alternatively, you could use awk in the command line for simple math: awk 'BEGIN { print total_base_pairs / 100000000 }' 

 What was your sequencing depth? (please write this down)

  In case your curious this is the full expanded form of Sequencing depth of coverage formula: 

  Sequencing depth of coverage = (Read length * Number of reads) / Genome size

<summary><b>Fastqc</b></summary>

Use vi to create a new file

    vi fastqc.sh

You should see the vi window with the ~ symbols. Type ‘i’ to get into input or insertion mode and then type the following into your file:
    
    #!/bin/bash

    #SBATCH --account acc_jfierst_classroom
    #SBATCH --partition highmem1
    #SBATCH --qos highmem1
    #SBATCH -n 8
    #SBATCH --output=output_fastqc.log
    #SBATCH --mail-user=username@email.com 	#use your own email instead
    #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL

    module load fastqc-0.11.7-gcc-4.8.5-72rtvom #code is loading the software needed

    mkdir -p fastqc_out   #code is saying if the directory doesn't already exist, make it

    fastqc JU4121_classPractice_ont.fastq -t 8 -o fastqc_out  #code is running the software on the input file with 8 threads and telling the output to be put in fastqc_out

Hit the escape button (‘esc’) to get out of insertion mode and type ‘:wq’ (without the single quotes) to save the file and exit vi. 

Submit the script:

    sbatch fastqc.sh

fastqc finishes in under a minute. The output is an html file in the directory fastqc_out. To view this, you need to download the file and open it in your preferred browser. To download a file from the HPC to your local machine, 

Go to the HPC dashboard tab that is currently open on your laptop. 

Click on the Files button.

Next, click on the Home Directory button.

Navigate to the file and check the white box next to it.

Finally, click the Download button in the top-right corner to download the file.

Your fastqc graphs should look something like:![screenshot](https://github.com/FierstLab/Bootcamp/blob/main/pictures/fastqc.png)

What are your shortest and longest reads?

What is the average quality score?

Notice the first few bases are really poor quality (I might have forgotten to trim the barcodes).

<summary><b>Flye</b></summary>

First we must download the flye software because it is not readily available on the HPC. If you don't believe me go ahead and try module avail flye. To install flye, we will use a version of conda called mamba. Type:

    module load mamba/23.1.0-4

Now that we have mamba loaded, we need to create an environment for flye. Type:

    mamba create -n flye

Once the environment is created, activate it with:

    source activate flye

You will know it worked when (flye) appears before your username $. With flye activated, download the software with:

    mamba install bioconda::flye

Now lets make a script with vi. 

    vi flye.sh

Copy and paste the following script. Make sure to read over it and change any relavent information like your email. 

    #!/bin/bash

    #SBATCH --account iacc_jfierst
    #SBATCH --partition highmem1
    #SBATCH --qos highmem1
    #SBATCH -n 12
    #SBATCH --output=output_flye.log
    #SBATCH --mail-user=username@fiu.edu    #use your own email instead
    #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL

    module load mamba/23.1.0-4   #load the softwares
    source activate flye

    flye --nano-hq JU4121_classPractice_ont.fastq --genome-size 100m --out-dir flye_out --threads 12   #run flye, specifying high quality nanopore data, the input file, the estimated genome size assumed from c.elegans, the output directory, and the number of threads the computer will use.

Your assembly will take about 40 minutes to complete. To check on the status of the job type: squeue --me. You can move forward with nextdenovo while you wait, but make sure you come back once it has completed. 

When finished, your assembly will be in the flye_out directory. cd into the directory and ls. You should see assembly.fasta. Type: ls -lath. What is the size of the file? 

Look at the file with: head assembly.fasta. You should notice a difference between a fasta and fastq. Unlike a fastq which has 4 lines (id, seq, +, quality), a fasta only has 2 lines. The first line is >contig_name, and the second is the sequence (ATCG). Type: 

grep -c ">" assembly.fasta 

How many contigs are in your assembly?

Finally, type: tail flye.log
You should see some assembly statistics including total assembly length, number of contigs (fragments), contig N50, largest contig, and the mean depth of coverage.

To see if your job is running type the following command:

    $ squeue --me
The final assembly result is at 03.ctg_graph/nd.asm.fasta

</details>

When the job is over you congrats you have assembled your first de novo genome(s)!! But wait there's more now its time to see the quality your genome assembly.

## Quality Check
Assembly quality has various measures. Things like N50, contig number, assembly size, k-mer counting, and gene presence/absence can all be indications of how good an assembly may be. It is a good idea to try multiple assembly methods and use these metrics to compare them. The "best" assembly is usually the most complete and contiguous. QUAST is particularly nice for comparing multiple assemblies at once.

First find the assembly file and store the file path a in txt file
    
    $ cd worm_data
    # Go to the directory that contains your genome assembly file
    $ cd 03.ctg_graph/
    # Use ls command to locate your assembly file. Your assembly file should be nd.asm.fasta
    $ ls
    # Save the path to this file in a txt file to use for your quast script.
    $ pwd > assembly_file_path.txt
    # View the contents of the file
    $ head -n 3 assembly_file_path.txt
    ## High light the output with your cursor (mouse) and then press ctrl + shift + c (This is the keyboard shortcut to copy txt, 
    we will paste the file path in the quast script)

QUAST calculates assembly metrics like N50, contig #, and assembly size. If given a reference, it can do more, like tell you about misassemblies, however, if the assembly is de novo then you do not have a reference.

    # Create bash script to run quast program
    $ vi quast_run.sh
Press [i] for insert mode and copy the below script
    
    #!/bin/bash

    #SBATCH ---account iacc_jfierst
    #SBATCH --qos=highmem1
    #SBATCH --partition=highmem1
    #SBATCH --output=out_%quast.log
    #SBATCH --mail-user=username@email.com   # Please use your own email
    #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL

    module load quast-5.2.0  
    # Replace (/your/path/to/01_rundir/genome_assembly_file.fasta) with the path to your assemble file. (This is a comment please don't copy it)
    # So paste your genome assembly file path by pressing, clt + shift + v
    # Remember your assembly file is called nd.asm.fasta. (This is a comment please don't copy it)
    quast.py -t 4 --eukaryote --plots-format pdf /your/path/to/01_rundir/genome_assembly_file.fasta -o ./nematode_quast/
    
    # Don't forget to add your assembly file (nd.asm.fasta) after pasting the file path (This is a comment please don't copy it)
Save by pressing [esc], type ":w". To exit type: ":q" and press [enter]

Now let's run the bash script quast_run.sh.

    $ sbatch quast_run.sh
    
    To see if your job is running type the following command:

    $ squeue --me


The html files are files that display the information in a graphical way using icarus viewer. To view these files, you need to download them to your local machine and then click to open them.

After the job is finished you'll see a new directory called  nematode_quast. If you cd (change directory) into the nematode_quast dirctory you'll see a file called icarus.html. We need to download this file on to our local machine (your personal laptop) to view its contents.
 
First go to the HPC dashboard tab that is currently open on your laptop. 

Click on the Files button.
Next, click on the Home Directory button.
Navigate to the nematode_quast directory.

Locate the icarus.html file within this directory.

To select the file, check the white box next to icarus.html.

Finally, click the Download button in the top-right corner to download the file.
(Isn't this harder than the command?)

Once you have download the file, double click the file to view the assembly statistics for your assembly!!

So what's your N50 and L50?
